# Bobcat

Bobcat is a tiny concatenative programming language inspired by Cat and Joy with the goal of writing expressive and fast behavior trees.

Bobcat compiles to C, and uses C functions for words. A Bobcat word has the following C signature:

    int word(const T input, const T input, ..., T* output, T* output, ...);

Where a non-zero return value returns the outer block.

## Syntax

The usual sequential functional composition

    2 dup mul # 4

The [comma operator](https://suhr.github.io/papers/calg.html), for function concatentation. Think of it as concatenating the input argument lists and output argument lists of each function.

    2 4 dup add,sqrt # 8 1.4142

Quotations, which push a function pointer on the stack. (Currently useless, without some magic sauce)

    [ words ]

Function declaration

    name: [ word word word ]

Bobcat does not have built-in loops and if statements.
It has behavior tree nodes with the following syntax

    node( word word word )

Which is roughly equivalent to the following, barring logic for early returns.

    node_pre word node word node word node node_post
